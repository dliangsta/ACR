### How to use:
You need docker set up and [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)) as well as nvidia driver 390 and CUDA installed. You can follow the setup guide [here](https://github.com/rwfilice/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildDigits.md) for details on installing the nvidia driver and CUDA.

Then dump all of your images into `./images` as `.jpg` files, run `./run.sh`. If you want to run the model over images in a different directory, change `./run.sh` accordingly.
